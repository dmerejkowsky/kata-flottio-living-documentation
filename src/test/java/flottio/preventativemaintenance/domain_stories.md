# Vehicule Maintenance Log 

From http://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates

Vertex42's new vehicle maintenance log template was created based on a user's request for a template to keep track of auto repairs and upkeep. It has all the requested features, including columns for the date of service, work performed, mileage at service, and cost. After creating it I discovered another very handy use. In addition to recording actual vehicle maintenance work, you can use the log to create a vehicle maintenance schedule. Now, before I take the car in for servicing, I'll print out my log with the recommended schedule so that I can tell whether I really need that "flush and replace every fluid in the entire vehicle" service.

Where can I find a recommended maintenance schedule? If you don't have the original service schedule that came with your vehicle, then you can do what I did and go to Edmund.com's Car Maintenance Guide to get the Manufacturer's Recommended Maintenance Schedule. I added a link to that page within the spreadsheet plus some fields at the top of the worksheet for recording some of the information you'll need (like the Make, Model, Year, Engine).
