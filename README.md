# Project Phenix
(Fuel Card Integration)

Project Manager: Andrea Willeave

## Syncs daily
Transaction data from the pump is automatically sent to Fleetio. No more manual entry of fuel receipts or downloading and importing fuel transactions across systems.

## Fuel Card Transaction Monitoring
Transaction data from the pump are verified automatically against various rules to detect potential frauds: gas leakage, transactions too far from the vehicle etc.

*The class responsible for that is called FuelCardMonitoring. Anomalies are detected if the vehicle is further than 300m away from the gas station, of if the transaction quantity exceeds the vehicle tank size by more than 5%* 

## Odometer readings
When drivers enter mileage at the pump, Fleetio uses that information to trigger service reminders. This time-saving approach helps you stay on top of maintenance and keeps your vehicles performing their best.

*This module is to be launched in February 2015. Please contact us for more details.*

## Smart fuel management
MPG and cost-per-mile are automatically calculated. Analyze your fuel spend from all angles - by vehicle, location, vehicle type, time frame.
