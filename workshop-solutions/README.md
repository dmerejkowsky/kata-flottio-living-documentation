# Fuel Card Integration

Here are the main features of this module:

## Syncs daily
Transaction data from the pump is automatically sent to Flottio. No more manual entry of fuel receipts or downloading and importing fuel transactions across systems.

## Fuel Card Transaction Monitoring
Transaction data from the pump are verified automatically against various rules to detect potential frauds: gas leakage, transactions too far from the vehicle etc.

## Odometer readings
When drivers enter mileage at the pump, Flottio uses that information to trigger service reminders. This time-saving approach helps you stay on top of maintenance and keeps your vehicles performing their best.

## Smart fuel management
MPG and cost-per-mile are automatically calculated. Analyze your fuel spend from all angles - by vehicle, location, vehicle type, time frame.
