# Living Documentation Workshop

## TODO

* Read contents of README.md and try to clean it up
* Read comments inside src/main/java/flottio/fuelcardmonitoring/domain/FuelCardMonitoring.java and clean them
* Say you wanted to have an evergreen glossary - how would you do it?
* Say you wanted to enforce hexagonal architecture - how would you do it?
